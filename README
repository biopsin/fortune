Fortune is a small game that is meant to lighten up your life.
It can be used to display a random entry from a cookie file.

There are many collections of cookie files, for example at

  ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/games/fortune/datfiles/

So why another fortune program?  Because the BSD one sucks.  It needs a
separate file and a program called "strfile" to create that said file.
Modern systems have mmap() which makes a simple fortune program almost
trivial to write, so I did it.

Comments welcome.  If anyone knows a canonical cookie repository, please
let me know!  Maybe we should start a new collection.  Methinks the
fortune cookie collection should be canonified and junk like duplicates
should be weeded.

Any takers?
