1.2:
  version 1.1 was lost, so I redid the changes from 1.1

1.1:
  less BSD and more POSIX.

1.0:
  removed stdio and locale crap.
  fortune now compiles against the diet libc (http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/)
    yielding a 12k statically linked binary on Linux/x86!

0.3 from 0.2:
  changed fortune separator from '%' to '\n%\n' to allow for fortunes
  with percent signs.

0.2 from 0.1:
  David Frey <dfrey@debian.org> contributed a man page and two important
  things that I wanted but were too lazy to do myself, namely regex
  based searching and more than one fortune file.  It looks like he also
  made a Debian package based on fortune!  Thanks, David!
